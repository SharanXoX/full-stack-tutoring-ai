    Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll pigments. 
    In this process, the energy from sunlight is converted into chemical energy and stored in the form of glucose.
    The general equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + Light Energy -> C6H12O6 + 6O2.
    Photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells.
    The process involves two main stages: light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle (light-independent reactions).
