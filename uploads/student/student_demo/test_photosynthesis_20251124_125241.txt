Photosynthesis: The Process of Plant Energy Production

Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants convert light energy into chemical energy. This process occurs primarily in the chloroplasts of plant cells, which contain the green pigment chlorophyll.

The Process:
Photosynthesis can be summarized by the following equation:
6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2

This means that carbon dioxide and water, in the presence of light, are converted into glucose and oxygen.

Two Main Stages:
1. Light-Dependent Reactions: These occur in the thylakoid membranes and require light. Water molecules are split, releasing oxygen as a byproduct.

2. Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle): These occur in the stroma and use the products from the light-dependent reactions to fix carbon dioxide into glucose.

Importance:
- Photosynthesis is the primary source of energy for nearly all life on Earth
- It produces oxygen that most organisms need to breathe
- It removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere

Factors Affecting Photosynthesis:
- Light intensity
- Carbon dioxide concentration
- Temperature
- Water availability
