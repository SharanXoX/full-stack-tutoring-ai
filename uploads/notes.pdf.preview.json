This guide provides an overview of how to create rubrics and outlines some best \npractices for rubric creation.  \n1. What is a rubric? \nRubrics, also known as auto-graders, are detailed sets of rules outlining the key components of \na model’s ideal response to a user prompt. Rubrics allow for scalable and consistent feedback \non model responses without the constant need for human input. For example, if a user were to \nask a model, “Who won the 2025 Super Bowl, and what was the winning score?” an appropriate \nrubric might read:  \n“States that the Philadelphia Eagles won the Super Bowl.”  \n“States that the winning score was 40-22.”  \n \nCrucially, to create quality eval sets, rubrics and prompts must exist in pairs. Rubrics cannot \nmeet the requisite levels of specificity detailed below without evaluating the model’s answer to a \nspecific question. Each rubric must be comprised of an exhaustive set of criteria that are clear, \nself-contained, and individual. \n2. What is a criterion? \nA criterion is one line item in a rubric. It describes what the model should or should not do in a \nspecific turn of the conversation.  \nA good criterion must be: \n-​\nA verifiable statement: the criterion must be a statement which can be verified with a \nsimple yes or no answer, but not phrased as question (e.g., “maintains a positive tone \nthroughout the essay” is a verifiable statement) \n-​\nClear: The criterion uses simple, unambiguous language that anyone can understand. \n-​\nMeasurable: The criterion describes behavior that can be observed and judged (not \nvague like “be good”). \n-​\nNon-Redundant: The criterion does not duplicate others and adds unique evaluation \nvalue. \n-​\nSelf-contained: The criterion can be used to evaluated on its own without extra context \nor hidden knowledge. \n \n\n \n3. What should a criterion include? \nEach criterion must include (for sect",
