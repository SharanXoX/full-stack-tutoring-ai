    Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the aid of chlorophyll. 
    Photosynthesis in plants generally involves the green pigment chlorophyll and generates oxygen as a byproduct.
    The process of photosynthesis is commonly written as: 6CO2 + 6H2O -> C6H12O6 + 6O2.
    This means that the reactants, six carbon dioxide molecules and six water molecules, are converted by light energy captured by chlorophyll into a sugar molecule and six oxygen molecules, the products.
